# Call the locate function to get a list of targeted files

# The script first calls the locate function to find all Python files in the current directory and its subdirectories that do not already contain the virus signature. It then calls the infect function to infect the targeted files by appending the first 39 lines of the virus code to the beginning of each file. Finally, it calls the detonate function, which checks the current date and prints a message to indicate that the virus has been activated if the date is May 9th. In summary, the script is a malicious program designed to infect Python files and potentially cause harm to the system.
